<h2>System Overview</h2>
<p>The following section provides an overview of the group’s implemented system based on State Spaces’ business processes. (Prototype of ONE function. Postgres and Django?)</p>

<h3>Buildings</h3>
<p>States Spaces maintains and provides venues for customers to reserve. Buildings owned by the company hold one or more venues. Each building is assigned a Building_ID along with a name, address, and city.</p>

<h3>Agents & Teams</h3>
<p>An agent manages one or more venues within the same building. Agents also manage teams that help with different aspects of venues. Agents have an Agent_ID and name, while teams have a Team_ID and job description.</p>

<h3>Venues & Renovations</h3>
<p>Each venue is assigned a Venue_ID along with a name, capacity, type, floor, floor_area in sqm, and an under_renovation boolean attribute reflective of the venue’s status. Renovations for each venue are kept track of, and each renovation has a Renovation_ID, start_date, and end_date.</p>

<h3>Amenities</h3>
<p>An amenity represents an item or furnishing of a particular make and model. It is characterized by its Amenity_ID, type, and description. Amenities are used by venues, and the quantity of a certain amenity for a particular venue is stored as a relationship attribute.</p>

<h3>Customers & Reservations</h3>
<p>Customers are characterized by their Customer_ID, name, birthday, and location. They can make reservations which, as an associative entity, have a Reservation_ID, participant quantity, and start and end times in both days and hours.</p>

<h3>Reservation Rules</h3>
<p>Customers can reserve one or more venues under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Participant quantity does not exceed the venue capacity</li>
    <li>No overlapping time periods</li>
    <li>Venue is not under renovation</li>
</ul>

<p>Pencil bookings are not permitted, and cancelled or rescheduled reservations are reflected in the system.</p>

<h3>Agent Responsibilities</h3>
<p>It is assumed that customers deal with the agent corresponding to their targeted venue, and this agent enforces restrictions and handles the necessary arrangements for customer reservations (quotation, reservation confirmation, etc.).</p>
